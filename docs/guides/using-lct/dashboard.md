# Dashboard

LCT provides a dashboard that summarizes and visualizes recent test runs.
It can be opened via the navigation menu on the left.

On the top, you can find some key metrics about the current LCT instance:

-   Number of apps tested
-   Number of worksheets
-   Number of active (non-deactivated) test cases
-   Number of existing and active Test Suites

Different diagrams are displayed across three tabs:

-   _Overall_:
    -   Executions diagram summarizes success/failure rates of all recent test executions
    -   Shows test development progress, measured by number of created and updated steps
-   _Worksheets_:
    -   Executions diagram summarizes success/failure rates of all recent worksheet executions
    -   Shows some worksheet statistics and a list of recently edited worksheets
-   _Test Suites_:
    -   Executions diagram summarizes success/failure rates of all recent Test Suite executions
    -   Shows some Test Suite statistics and a list of recently edited Test Suites

On the left side there are some filters:

-   _Interval_: Set the time interval for the execution success/failure diagrams
-   _Worksheets_: Choose specific worksheets for all stats
-   _Applications_: Filter by worksheets that test one of the selected applications

Setting a filter updates all diagrams and lists on the page.
