# Release notes for LCT version 0.17

## New features

- **Before-Each and After-Each cases:** These two new kind of cases have been added to LCT. This allows to execute a number of steps before or after each case in a worksheet. Making repetitive tasks such as loggin in, data preparation or data clean up much easier to accomplish and with less replication of steps.

- **Add new case rework:** The links to add a new case in the case overview have been migrated to a separate modal page. This reduces the ammount of entries in the previuos menu and should be more intuitive to APEX users being reminiscent to the way one would add a new page there.
