# WaitMilliseconds

Simply stops execution for a specified number of milliseconds.

:::caution

We don't recommend using this step unless you have an unstable DOM (where elements appear and disappear).
Prefer assertions that wait for elements to appear instead. For example use **seeElement** or **containsText**.
